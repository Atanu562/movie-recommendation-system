#### 🚀 Movie Recommendation System — ML Project

I recently built a Movie Recommendation Engine that suggests films to users based on their preferences and rating behavior — similar to how OTT platforms personalize your watchlist.

### 🧠 Objective

Create an intelligent system that analyzes movie ratings and recommends similar movies using similarity-based machine learning techniques.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages & Libraries: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn

Concepts Used: Collaborative Filtering, Cosine Similarity, Correlation

Tools: PyCharm, Streamlit, Jupyter Notebook

Dataset: **TMDB** dataset

#### ⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ Load and preprocess movie & rating datasets.

2️⃣ Create a user-movie interaction matrix.

3️⃣ Apply similarity algorithms:

Cosine Similarity
Pearson Correlation

4️⃣ Find users with similar taste.

5️⃣ Recommend movies those similar users liked but the target user hasn’t watched.

#### 📊 Features Implemented

Personalized movie recommendations

Similar movie suggestion system

User preference pattern visualization

Interactive UI using Streamlit.
